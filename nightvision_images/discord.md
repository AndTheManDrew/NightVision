**New Combat effects**:   
Light now affects ranged and melee hit chance, ranged cooldown, melee dodge, and adds a melee sneak attack chance.

**New AI changes**:   
Enemies will prefer cover in darkness.  
Humanoid enemies aggro range now depends on their light multiplier i.e. without night vision, range is decreased at night (relevant when attacking siege camps and outposts)

**New Raid Type**:  
Raid that can only trigger during a solar flare. Takes advantage of night vision.
  
  
  
**Night vision:**  
    No slow down in darkness (Can be applied by Apparel, Bionics, Races)

**Photosensitivity:**  
    Faster in darkness, slower in bright light (Can be applied by Bionics, Races;  Apparel can remove the debuff)

-Customisable settings for apparel (e.g. add night vision to the cowboy hat)
